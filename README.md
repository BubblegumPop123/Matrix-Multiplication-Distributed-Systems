# Matrix-Multiplication-Distributed-Systems

This repository contains multiple methodologies of communication and parallel processing using MPI and OpenMP concepts.

The first file contains matrix multiplications on a serial system.
The second file contains matrix multiplications on a parallel system.
The third file contains matrix multiplications through strassen's multiplication method on a parallel system.

# Pre-requisites:
Please make sure you have MPI installed into your systems.
This repository is intended for multiple distributed systems and multiple instances of processes.
You can download and set up multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine in order to test and benchmark these codes for yourself.
For more information of observations and results, please refer to the information in report.pdf.
